    const message = `Eid Mubarak, [Her Name]

Today, the moon smiles brighter, the skies stretch a little wider,
and even the wind hums a gentler tune —
as if the universe itself pauses for a moment to celebrate souls like yours.

On this blessed day, I won’t speak of love that waits or wishes —
I’ll speak only of the light you carry,
the quiet grace with which you move through this world,
and the peace you bring to hearts without even trying.

You may not know it — or perhaps you do —
but in your laughter, there’s a kind of prayer,
and in your silence, a kind of poetry.

I have loved — yes — but more than that,
I have learned from you the calm strength of patience,
the beauty of simplicity,
and the joy of seeing someone bloom just as they are meant to,
even from a respectful distance.

May this Eid bring you the kind of happiness that feels like home,
the kind of peace that doesn’t need noise,
and the kind of love that wraps itself quietly around your soul,
asking for nothing in return.

Eid Mubarak once again.
May Allah keep you smiling always.

— Yours, quietly and sincerely,
[Abdul Wassay]`;
